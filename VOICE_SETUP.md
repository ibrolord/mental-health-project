## How It Works

### Voice Input (Speech-to-Text)
- Uses your browser's microphone
- Transcribed by **OpenAI Whisper** (best accuracy)
- Sent to AI chat (Gemini/Claude)

### Voice Output (Text-to-Speech)
- AI response generated (text)
- Converted to speech by **OpenAI TTS-HD**
- "Nova" voice (warm, empathetic female voice)
- Slightly slower speed for a calmer support tone

## Usage

1. Go to **AI Chat** page
2. Click **"🎙️ Voice Mode"** button
3. Grant microphone permission
4. Click **"Start Talking"** and speak naturally
5. AI will respond with voice
